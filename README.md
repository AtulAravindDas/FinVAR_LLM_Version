FinVAR 2: The LLM version

# The Lore about FinVAR's LLM Version(fun stuff)

Long long time ago in a place far away from home, a BU MS in Data Science student was sitting in his room in Boston. The guy always wanted(and still wants) to work a FinTech company so that he can be mentored by the best in the business and be really efficient in it. Suddenly, he sees an [Investopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp) talking about risk and what it means in investments. Then, the guy, who always wanted to implement LLMs(and plans to pretrain LLMs in the future if given a chance) got an idea of solving a simple question using it. The simple question was this: " How risky is it to invest in a particular ticker?" The guy, then decides to create an app for it.Behold FinVAR's LLM version. Created using LangChain and Chainlit(still WIP), this app feeds the LLM with the inputs from SEC-Edgar 10-K risk sections and FinancialModelingPrep financial data and inferences the risk level of investing in a ticker.
